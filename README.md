👋 Hey there! I’m Davood Khobbakht
I’m a Python & WordPress Developer with a deep love for automation, SEO magic, and building tools that make the web work smarter — not harder.

Over the past 15+ years, I’ve gone from writing my first cout<<"Hello World"; to crafting full-stack applications, web scrapers, API integrations, and SEO automation systems used in real businesses.

💡 I believe in clean code, creative problem-solving, and turning ideas into practical, beautiful solutions — whether that’s a sleek e-commerce site, an AI-powered content generator, or a system that updates thousands of product prices automatically while I drink my coffee. ☕

🚀 What I Do Best
Python/Django wizardry – from scalable web apps to complex business workflows.

SEO Automation – built tools like SeoThis to auto-generate product descriptions, meta tags, and blogs.

Web Scraping & Data Magic – price monitoring, competitor analysis, and real-time updates with Selenium.

WordPress Engineering – custom themes, WooCommerce integrations, Elementor landing pages.

API Integrations – REST, SOAP, multi-threaded requests, secure token-based logins.

Front-End Crafting – HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript that looks good and works fast.

🌟 A Few Highlights
Automated WooCommerce SEO content creation for hundreds of products.

Built POS device sales & registration system with role-based dashboards.

Developed a dynamic price updater that never sleeps.

Created and deployed multiple corporate websites, bots, and automation tools.

💬 A Little About Me

Thrives in creative teams

Stays curious and experiments with new tech

Enjoys teaching and helping others grow

When I’m not coding, you might find me designing something new, diving into SEO trends, or exploring how AI can supercharge online business growth.
